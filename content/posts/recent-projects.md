# Recent Projects

A look at some of my recent projects and the challenges I faced while working on them.

## Project 1: Minimalist Portfolio Template

I created a minimalist portfolio template for designers and developers who want to showcase their work in a clean, distraction-free environment.

### Challenges:

- Balancing minimalism with enough visual interest to engage visitors
- Creating a responsive design that works well on all devices
- Optimizing performance while maintaining visual quality

## Project 2: Typography Exploration

This was a personal project exploring the impact of typography on user experience and readability.

### Key Findings:

- Serif fonts like Instrument Serif can work beautifully for digital interfaces when used at appropriate sizes
- Line height and letter spacing have a significant impact on readability
- Font pairing is an art that requires careful consideration of contrast and harmony

I'll be sharing more detailed case studies of these projects in future posts.
