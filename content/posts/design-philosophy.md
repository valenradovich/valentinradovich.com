# Design Philosophy

Exploring the principles of minimalist design and how it influences my work and creative process.

## Embracing Minimalism

Minimalism isn't just about using fewer elements—it's about being intentional with every choice.

> Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
> — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

### Key Principles I Follow:

1. **Clarity of purpose** - Every element should serve a clear function
2. **Reduction of noise** - Remove anything that doesn't contribute to the core message
3. **Thoughtful spacing** - Use whitespace deliberately to create rhythm and focus
4. **Limited palette** - Constrain color and typography choices for cohesion

These principles guide not just my visual design work, but also how I approach problems and build solutions.
